# Reuse

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

We created a numeric input for Germany.

For example, 
If a user enters '14,5', the value will be 14.5.

The custom number input is used in summing up two double numbers.
The two numbers are initially 450.234 and 254.12.
You can modify the numbers as you like.

## NPM Install

Run `npm install` before you run project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
